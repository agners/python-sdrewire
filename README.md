# Python tools for SDReWire

This repository contains Python tools for [SDReWire](https://github.com/randomplum/sdrewire).
Currently the command line utility `sdrewirectl` is the only utility.

Muxing can be controlled using:
```
$ sdrewire sdmux --ts
$ sdrewire sdmux --status
SD mux connected to: TS
$ sdrewire sdmux --dut
$ sdrewire sdmux --status
SD mux connected to: DUT
```
